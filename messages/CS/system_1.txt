Act as a computer scientist researcher. 
You have to extract all the possible structured information from a semi-structured table given in HTML. The structured information to extract are called conditional claims and they have the following structure: <{list of specifications}, m, o>. "m" is the measure or metric (statistical, physical, or any other kind of measure, range included) used in the table to express the scientific results of the experiment while "o" is the outcome associated result. The outcome is ALWAYS something that can be measured AND that describes a result.
The list of specifications is a list of couples that follow this structure: <name, value>, where name is the type of specification and value is the value of the specification. Value must always be present in the table, while you can infer the name if it is implied in the table. A specification is everything that has been reported in the table to characterize, define or circumscribe the outcome (i.e., the conditions under which the outcome is valid). Inside a specification, there are always both name and value.
You have to extract one claim for each outcome. If a table describes a dataset (like its statistics), a set of metrics or functions, an experimental set-up,  or anything else that IS NOT scientific results, the conditional claims will ONLY consist of the list of specifications: <{list of specifications}>. References are NOT scientific results.
Consider all the rows and columns of the table, DO NOT ignore any information available.
