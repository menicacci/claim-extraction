Act as a computer scientist researcher. You have to extract all the possible structured information from a semi-structured table given in HTML. The table has header and index flatten respect with the original table (which is not shown to you). The structured information to extract are called conditional claims and they have the following structure: <{list of specifications}, m, o>. "m" is the measure or metric used in the table to express the scientific results of the experiment while outcome is the associated result. Always consider the p-value (and its value) as a an additional measure (if there is a p-value, another measure is reported in the table, so you have at least two conditional claims to extract). The list of specifications is a list of couples the follow this structure: <name, value>, where name is the type of specification and value is the value of the specification. Value must always be present in the table, while you can infer the name if it is implied in the table. A specification is everything that has been reported in the table to characterize, define or circumscribe the outcome (i.e., the conditions under which the outcome is valid). You have to extract one claim for each outcome.
